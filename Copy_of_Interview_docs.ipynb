        "## Overview of Labelbox\n",
        "\n",
        "Labelbox is designed to streamline the process of creating, managing and training data for intelligent applications. It provides tools and workflows for annotating, managing, and interating over data, enabling data scientists and machine learning engineers to build high-quality training datasets efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's an overview of the main components and features of the Labelbox application:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Data Import**: Labelbox allows users to import various types of data, including images, videos, text, and conversational data, from different sources such as local files, cloud storage (e.g., Google Cloud Storage, Amazon S3), and public URLs.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Data Annotation**: Users can create and customize labeling projects for different types of data. Labeling tools include bounding boxes, polygons, keypoints, and segmentation masks, among others. Users can define custom label schemas and workflows tailored to their specific use cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Automation and Model Integration**: Labelbox provides unique functionality to automate the annotation process, and it allows users to significantly speed up workflows. It provides access to a variety of pre-built labeling models, such as those for object detection and text classification (partial functionality is available in the UI) . Moreover, Labelbox empowers users to assess the performance of their custom models, enabling them to fine-tune and optimize their machine learning pipelines.\n",
        "\n",
        "Labelbox also provides an SDK for customizing workflows, and automating tasks.\n"
